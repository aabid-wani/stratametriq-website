# StrataMetriq: Architecture Intelligence & Pre-Deployment Safety

> **StrataMetriq helps engineering teams understand software architecture, predict the impact of code changes, and prevent risky deployments before they happen.**

Welcome to the authoritative engineering guide and user manual for **StrataMetriq**, an enterprise-grade Visual Studio Code extension and DevSecOps CLI designed to deliver **Architecture Intelligence & Pre-Deployment Safety** for full-stack polyglot codebases (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Kotlin, Go, C#).

> **INFO:** 🌐 VS Code Marketplace & Registry
**VS Code Marketplace Identifier:** `stratametriq.stratametriq-extension`

## 💡 Why StrataMetriq?

In modern software organizations, engineers frequently grapple with hidden architectural debt, tangled module dependencies, and accidental production leaks (such as exposed API keys, debug logs, or unfinished TODOs). To gain comprehensive visibility, developers typically must stitch together **3 to 4 separate, expensive tools**—such as static code analyzers, secret scanners, dependency visualizers, and duplicate code detectors.

**StrataMetriq** unifies these capabilities into a single, native VS Code experience:

> **TIP:** 360° Architectural Visibility
Natively maps your entire workspace dependency graph, API routing topology, and database interactions in real time.


> **NOTE:** Zero Cloud Exfiltration
Unlike SaaS code scanners that upload proprietary source code to remote servers, StrataMetriq performs **100% of its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing and graph calculations locally** on your machine. Your code never leaves your IDE.


> **INFO:** Non-Blocking Performance
Engineered with highly optimized tokenizers and TypeScript AST evaluators that parse thousands of lines of code in seconds without freezing or slowing down your editor.

## 🏛️ Enterprise Custom Architecture Governance

StrataMetriq allows Principal Architects and DevOps leaders to enforce organizational architecture standards across layered codebases and monorepos using a root **`stratametriq.config.yml`** configuration file.

```yaml
version: 1
rules:
  - name: "UI layer cannot import Database layer directly"
    source: "src/ui/**"
    forbiddenTarget: "src/db/**"
    severity: "HIGH"
    message: "UI components must go through src/services/ or API endpoints."
```

* **Instant IDE Prevention**: Forbidden imports are flagged in real time with inline diagnostic squiggles and status bar warnings inside VS Code.
* **Automated CI/CD Gates**: Running `npx @stratametriq/cli scan . --fail-on-high` blocks pull requests if architectural boundaries are violated.
* **Actionable Remediation**: Outputs immediate 1-line `💡 Fix` instructions beneath every finding.

## 🔬 Most Complex Modules & Risk Impact Analysis

### 1. 🧩 Most Complex Modules Analysis
StrataMetriq automatically computes cyclomatic complexity and AST token density across every source file in your repository:
* **Complexity Scoring**: Ranks modules based on branching density, nested conditional logic, and total AST nodes.
* **Dashboard Complex Modules Card**: Displays the top most complex files in your codebase with clear metric bars so engineering managers and tech leads can prioritize refactoring technical debt.
* **1-Click Graph Isolation**: Clicking any complex module instantly focuses the visual dependency graph on that file and highlights its upstream/downstream connections.

### 2. ⚡ Intelligent Risk Impact Analysis & Ripple Mechanics
When inspecting any module in the StrataMetriq dashboard, the **Risk Impact Analysis** panel answers *"If I change this file, what else is affected and why?"*:
* **💡 "Why & How Are These Affected?" Explanation Card**:
  * **Dependency Ripple Chain**: Shows exact counts for **Direct Importers** (`[Direct Importer]` badge) versus **Transitive Dependents** (`[Transitive]` badge).
  * **API Contract Risk**: Explains which server API routes rely on the file and warn against breaking response payload contracts.
  * **UI Component Tree**: Lists affected React/UI components that will undergo re-renders or layout changes.
* **➕ Adding vs. Modifying Code Mechanics**:
  * **Adding New Code / Endpoints**: Non-breaking (`0 ripple risk`). New functions or routes do not affect existing consumers until explicitly imported.
  * **Modifying Existing Exports**: High ripple risk across all listed dependents.
* **🎨 Native VS Code Editor Left-Gutter Decorations**:
  * Duplicate logic blocks and high-risk modules are automatically decorated with a **solid purple/cyan left gutter strip** and inline hover diagnostics directly inside your active VS Code editor window.

## 📦 Quick Start (2 Powerful Modes)

### Mode 1: Interactive VS Code Extension (VSIX)
1. **Install from VSIX:** Open VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P`), type and select **`Extensions: Install from VSIX...`**, and choose the bundled extension package (**`stratametriq-extension-1.4.4.vsix`**).
2. **Reload VS Code:** Run **`Developer: Reload Window`** to activate the latest scanner engine.
3. **Launch Dashboard:** Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run: **`StrataMetriq: Open Dashboard`**.

### Mode 2: Headless DevSecOps CLI (Terminal / CI/CD)
Run directly in any directory without global installation:
```bash
# Local terminal scan
npx @stratametriq/cli scan .

# Run downstream BFS impact analysis on a specific file ("what breaks if I edit this?")
npx @stratametriq/cli impact src/services/UserService.ts

# CI/CD Pipeline Gate: Block build if HIGH severity vulnerabilities exist
npx @stratametriq/cli scan ./src --fail-on-high

# Export JSON & Markdown PR report
npx @stratametriq/cli scan . --fail-on-high --json report.json --md pr-comment.md
```
